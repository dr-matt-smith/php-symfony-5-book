# The Composer PHP library tool

The Composer tool is actually a **PHAR** (PHP Archive) - i.e. a PHP application packaged into a single file. So ensure you have PHP installed and in your environment **path** before attempting to install or use Composer.

Ensure you have (or install) an up-to-date version of the Composer PHP package manager.

```bash
    composer self-update
```

### Windows Composer install
