## Composer
Composer is a **fantastic** PHP tool for managing project dependencies (the libraries and class packages used by OO PHP projects).

1. ensure that Composer is up to date by running:

    ```bash
        composer self-update
    ```

2. enable the PDO options for MySQL and SQLite (see Appendix \ref{appendix_php} for how to do this by editing ther `c:\php\php.ini` file ...)




The Composer tool is actually a **PHAR** (PHP Archive) - i.e. a PHP application packaged into a single file. So ensure you have PHP installed and in your environment **path** before attempting to install or use Composer.

Ensure you have (or install) an up-to-date version of the Composer PHP package manager.

```bash
    composer self-update
```
