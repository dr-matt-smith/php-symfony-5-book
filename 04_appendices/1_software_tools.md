# Software required for Symfony development\label{appendix_software}

## Don't confuse different software tools

Please do not confuse the following:

- Git and Github
- PHP and PHPStorm

Here is a short description of each:

- Git: A version control system - can run locally or on networked computer. There are several website that support Git projects, including:

    - Github (perhaps the most well known)
    - Gitlab
    - Bitbucket
    - you can also create and run your own Git web server ...

- Github: A commercial (but free for students!) cloud service for storing and working with projects using the Git version control system

- PHP: A computer programming language, maintained by an international Open Source community and published at `php.net`

- PHPStorm: A great (and free for student!) IDE - Interactive Development Enviroment. I.e. a really clever text editor created just for working with PHP projects. PHPStorm is one of the professional software tools offered by the **Jetbrains** company.

So in summary, Git and PHP are open source core software. Github and PHPStorm are commercial (but free for students!) tools that support development using Git and PHP.

## Software tools

Ensure you have the following setup for developing Symfony software on your local machine

- PHP 7.2.5 or later (free, open source)
- Composer (up-to-date with `composer self-update`)(free, open source - a PHP program!)
- PHPStorm (with educational free account if you're a student!) - or some other editor of your choice
- MySQL Workbench (Community Edition free)
- Git (free, open source)


See Appendix \ref{appendix_php} for checking, and if necessary, installing PHP on your computer.
See Appendix \ref{appendix_software} for details about other software needed for working with PHP projects.

## Test software by creating a new Symfony 4 project

Test your software by using PHP and Composer to create a new Symfony 4 project. We'll follow the steps at the [Symfony setup](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup.html) web page.

Follow the steps in Appendix \ref{appendix_sf_basic}.
