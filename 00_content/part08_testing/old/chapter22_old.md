## UPDATE STATUS
NOTE - these chapters are currently being updated for Symfony 4

The status of this chapter is:

- out of date (old Symfony 3)   <<<<<<<< current status
- updated and okay for now
- very up to date



## Codeception (`project23`)

Codeception is a BDD approach to TDD. TDD is Test-Driven Development, where we wrÂ§ite tests then write code to pass the tests. BDD is Behaviour-Driven Development, where the tests are expressed in terms of 'user actions'.

## Setting up Codeception for a Symfony project

First create a new Symfony project, e.g.:

```bash
    $ symfony new project20
```

or using Composer:

```bash
    $ composer create-project symfony/framework-standard-edition project20
```

Now download the Codeception PHAR (PHp ARchive) from the Codeception download page:

- (Codeception download/install page)[http://codeception.com/install]

Copy this PHAR to the root of your new project - e.g. to `/project20/`.

Now **bootstrap** codeception:

```bash
    php codecept.phar bootstrap
```

This should createl the folling:

```
    /tests
    codeception.yml
```

Now generate a **Welcome** acceptance test:

```
    php codecept.phar generate:cept acceptance Welcome
```

This should create file:

```
    /tests/acceptance/Welcomecept.php
```

Let's change the contents of this to the following (since our Symfony home page displays text such as 'Welcome to Symfony 3.2.4. Your application is now ready.':

```php
    $I = new AcceptanceTester($scenario);
    $I->wantTo('ensure that frontpage works');
    $I->amOnPage('/');
    $I->see('Welcome to');
    $I->see('Symfony');
```

This test attempts to request URL "/" from the web host (we'll define that next). This test also attempts to see text 'Welcome to' and 'Symfony' in the HTML page content (which it should on the home page).

We need to tell Codeception the host and port to look at when simulating user interactions with the website. We do this by editing the vales in `/tests/acceptance.suite.yml/`. I'm running my webserer on port 8000, so I set my `acceptance.suite.yml` to the following:

```yaml
    class_name: AcceptanceTester
    modules:
        enabled:
            - PhpBrowser:
                url: http://localhost:8000
            - \Helper\Acceptance
```

We now run our Symfony application server, and test our Codeception acceptance test with the followng command line statement:

```bash
    php codecept.phar run
```

Figure \ref{} shows the CLI output when we run (this hopefully passing) test.

**NOTE** If you are **not** running the web server,  then you'll just get an error.

## Using PHPUnit latest stable release

It's always recommend that you use the most recent **stable** release of any software tool or package. Therefore when testing with PHPUnit you should ensure you have the latest stable version. Check at the PHPUnit home page (see Figure \ref{phpunit_website}:

```
    https://phpunit.de/
```

![Current stable release on PHPUnit website. \label{phpunit_website}](./03_figures/testing/01_phpunit_website_sm.png)

The current stable release can be downloaded as a PHAR (PHp-ARchive) - it's usually the green one on the left...

## Issue (and solution) with polyfills (namespacing change)

The **PROBLEM**:

Due to an issue of the difference between `PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase` (pre-namespacing class naming convention) and `PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase` (namespacing convention), and a core PHP `bridge` tool, currently PHPUnit 6.x does not work with Symfony 3 without some tinkering with a kernel test case. You can read more about this here:

```
    https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/21534
```

So if we try to run PHPUnit we get this error message:

```
    PHP Fatal error:  Class 'PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase' not found in
    /home/user/project/vendor/symfony/symfony/src/Symfony/Bundle/FrameworkBundle/Test/KernelTestCase.php
    on line 23

```

So for now download and use PHPunit 5.7 (the orange, old stable release)

This issue will probably be solved in the next month or two, since both Symfony and PHPUnit are open source community projects and so people work hard and fast to solve compatibility issues with new releases.

The **SOLUTION**:

We need to change one line, in file `KernelTestCase.php`:

```php
    use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;
```

to this line:


```php
    use PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase as TestCase;
```

The location of `KernelTestCase.php` is:

```
    /vendor
        /symfony
            /symfony
                /src
                    /Symfony
                        /Bundle
                            /FrameworkBundle
                                /Test
```

Figure \ref{namespace_fix} shows the code having been corrected for `project20`.

## Testing in Symfony

Symfony is built by a test-test open source community. There is a lot of information about how to test Symfony in the offical documdentation pages:

- [Symfony testing](http://symfony.com/doc/current/testing.html)

- [Testing with user authentication tokens](http://symfony.com/doc/current/testing/simulating_authentication.html)

- [How to Simulate HTTP Authentication in a Functional Test](http://symfony.com/doc/current/testing/http_authentication.html)
